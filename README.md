# A-Study-of-Remote-Procedure-Call

## 摘要 Abstract
Remote Procedure call is a software communication protocol that one program can use to request a service from another located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. In this study, we use alpine docker image as the environment to implement the Remote Procedure Call service, and build two containers with bridge network based on this image as client and server. In this study, we will introduce how to build the entire system including docker and RPC service, and how to use the system. Moreover, we have pushed the project image on Docker Hub, so that everyone can test whether the service is worked well.
